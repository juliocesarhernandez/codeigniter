# front-end-sr-test

Test Instructions

The repo contains a basic starter project structure. You could find the layouts inside the creative folder. Build the project using HTML5, Bootstrap, Font-Awsome and jQuery. The finished project should be responsive. You need to create a new branch naming it by your email.

If you don't know how to use Github, build the layout, zip it, and email it to genius-development@kichink.com
